## üéØ How It Works

### YouTube Videos
When playing YouTube videos:
1. Track metadata is sent to the Media Session API
2. Playback state is synchronized automatically
3. Controls trigger YouTube IFrame API commands
4. Audio continues in background even when screen is off

### Local Audio Files
When playing local files:
1. HTML5 Audio element handles playback
2. Media Session receives metadata updates
3. Native audio playback ensures battery efficiency
4. Files continue playing with screen locked

---

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Code Locations

**Media Session Functions** (`app.js` lines 857-980):
```javascript
- updateMediaSession(track)        // Updates metadata
- initMediaSessionHandlers()       // Sets up controls
```

**Playback State Updates**:
- YouTube: `onPlayerStateChange()` (lines 818-838)
- Local Files: `playLocalFile()` and `togglePlay()` (lines 727-788)

**Track Info Integration**:
- `updateTrackInfo()` (lines 1169-1188)

## üí° Best Practices for Users

### To Ensure Smooth Background Playback:

1. **Install as PWA** (Progressive Web App)
   - Tap "Add to Home Screen" in your browser
   - This provides the best background playback experience

2. **Grant Permissions**
   - Allow notifications (some browsers require this)
   - Allow autoplay (improves user experience)

3. **Keep Browser Updated**
   - Ensure you're using the latest version of your mobile browser

4. **Battery Optimization**
   - Disable "Battery Optimization" for your browser app
   - This prevents the OS from killing background audio

### ‚ö° Power Saving Tips:
- Local files use less battery than streaming
- Lower volume = longer battery life
- Close unused apps to free up memory

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Music Stops When Screen Locks
**Solution:**
1. Check if battery optimization is enabled for your browser
2. Ensure the browser has background app refresh permissions
3. Try installing the app as a PWA

### Controls Don't Appear in Notifications
**Solution:**
1. Start playing music first, then lock the screen
2. Check notification permissions for the browser
3. Try refreshing the page

### Music Stops When Switching Apps
**Solution:**
1. This may be due to aggressive memory management
2. Install as PWA for better stability
3. Close other memory-intensive apps
