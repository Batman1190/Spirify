# YouTube Player - Conflict Fixes & Responsive Design

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **Mobile Overlap Issues** ✅
**Problem**: YouTube player overlapped with player bar on mobile devices

**Solutions**:
- **Mobile (≤768px)**: Moved player from `bottom: 80px` to `bottom: 150px` (clears 140px player bar + margin)
- **Small Mobile (≤480px)**: Adjusted to `bottom: 170px` (clears 160px player bar + margin)
- **Landscape Mobile**: Positioned at `bottom: 110px` with reduced width (320px)
- **Minimized state**: Special positioning that stays just above player bar

### 2. **Z-Index Conflicts** ✅
**Problem**: YouTube player (z-index: 900) could interfere with modals (z-index: 1000+)

**Solutions**:
- Added `modal-open` class to body when any modal opens
- YouTube player drops to z-index: 899 when modals are active
- Player interactions disabled (`pointer-events: none`) during modals

### 3. **Modal Management** ✅
**Problem**: Inconsistent modal handling causing conflicts

**Solutions**:
- Created `openModal()` and `closeModal()` helper functions
- All modals now use unified system
- Body class `modal-open` tracked across all modal operations
- Cassette, Playlist, AddToPlaylist, and API modals all integrated

### 4. **Responsive Sizing** ✅
**Desktop**: 400px width, 225px height
**Tablets**: 360px width, 200px height
**Mobile**: Full width (with margins), 180px height
**Small Mobile**: Full width, 160px height
**Landscape**: 320px width, 150px height
**Very Small (<360px)**: Hidden when minimized

### 5. **Toggle Functionality** ✅
- Click header or toggle button to minimize/maximize
- State persists in localStorage
- Arrow icon rotates 180° when minimized
- Smooth transitions with CSS animations
