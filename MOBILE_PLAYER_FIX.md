# YouTube Player Mobile Fix - Quick Reference

## Problem
The YouTube player was covering almost the entire mobile screen and wouldn't minimize properly.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. **Default to Minimized on Mobile** ✅
- Player now starts **minimized by default** on mobile devices (≤768px width)
- Desktop users see it maximized by default
- User preferences are saved and respected on subsequent visits

### 2. **Proper Minimization Transform** ✅
- Fixed the `transform: translateY()` to work correctly on mobile
- Minimized player now shows **only the header bar (48px)**
- Video iframe and links are **completely hidden** when minimized (using `display: none`)

### 3. **Visual Feedback** ✅
- Added "• Tap to expand" hint text on minimized header
- Added touch feedback (background highlight on tap)
- Arrow icon rotates to indicate state

### 4. **Responsive Positioning** ✅
- **Mobile Portrait**: Bottom 150px (clears player bar)
- **Small Mobile**: Bottom 170px (clears taller player bar)
- **Landscape**: Bottom 110px, width 320px (side-positioned)

### 5. **Orientation Handling** ✅
- Automatically adjusts on device rotation
- Re-evaluates optimal state when screen size changes
- Only auto-adjusts if user hasn't manually set a preference

## User Experience

### On First Load (Mobile):
1. Player appears as **small header bar only** at bottom
2. Shows "Powered by YouTube • Tap to expand"
3. Tapping header expands to show video player

### When Expanded:
1. Full video player visible with controls
2. YouTube ToS and Privacy Policy links shown
3. "Watch on YouTube" button available
4. Tapping header collapses back to minimize

### Preference Memory:
- If user expands on mobile, preference is saved
- Next visit will remember: expanded or minimized
- Clearing localStorage resets to default (minimized on mobile)

## Technical Changes

### `styles.css`
```css
/* Minimized state now properly hides content */
.youtube-player-container.minimized .youtube-player-iframe,
.youtube-player-container.minimized .youtube-links {
    display: none;
}

/* Transform works on mobile */
.youtube-player-container.minimized {
    transform: translateY(calc(100% - 48px));
}

/* Visual hint */
.youtube-player-container.minimized .youtube-attribution::after {
    content: ' • Tap to expand';
}
```

### `app.js`
```javascript
// Smart default based on device
if (savedState !== null) {
    shouldMinimize = savedState === 'true';
} else {
    shouldMinimize = isMobileDevice() || window.innerWidth <= 768;
}

// Auto-adjust on resize (if no saved preference)
window.addEventListener('resize', () => {
    // Re-evaluate optimal state on orientation change
});
```

## Testing Checklist

### Mobile Portrait (≤768px)
- [ ] Player starts minimized (only header visible)
- [ ] Shows "Powered by YouTube • Tap to expand"
- [ ] Tapping header expands player
- [ ] Video player is visible and functional when expanded
- [ ] Tapping header again minimizes it
- [ ] Doesn't cover player bar controls

### Mobile Landscape
- [ ] Player positioned on right side
- [ ] Width is 320px (doesn't dominate screen)
- [ ] Minimized state still works
- [ ] Doesn't interfere with playback controls

### Small Screens (≤480px)
- [ ] Extra bottom spacing (170px)
- [ ] Player height reduced to 160px when expanded
- [ ] Text wraps properly in links section

### Preference Persistence
- [ ] Expanding on mobile saves preference
- [ ] Reloading page maintains expanded state
- [ ] Clearing localStorage resets to minimized default

### Orientation Change
- [ ] Rotating device adjusts player position
- [ ] User preference is maintained if set
- [ ] Auto-adjusts if no preference set

## Before vs After

### Before:
❌ Player covers entire mobile screen  
❌ No way to minimize on mobile  
❌ Transform doesn't work  
❌ User has to scroll past it  

### After:
✅ Player starts as small header (48px)  
✅ Tap to expand when needed  
✅ Clean minimize/maximize with animation  
✅ Doesn't obstruct content or controls  

## Quick Test Command
To test the fix, on mobile browser:
1. Open the app
2. Player should show only "Powered by YouTube • Tap to expand"
3. Tap to expand → video player appears
4. Tap again → minimizes back to header
5. Reload page → preference is remembered
